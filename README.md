# TicTacToe

For this project, I've started using Figma. Therefore, I've created some mockups and afterwards I developed this web app. Have fun with this little Tic Tac Toe game. :)
Take a look at my mockup: https://shorturl.at/acwy3

Check it ou on my Github page: https://afuhge.github.io/TicTacToe/start

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.2.0.

# Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
